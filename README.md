# Classificaton-models
in the following project i empirically estimated the performance of several
classification algorithms.  Perceptron,logistic regression,LDA,SVM,DecisionTree
files:
 model.py: contain implemntation of Classificaton models.each model defind as a class and support the methods model.fit(),model.predict,model.score()
 comperasion.py:example of comperasion between the classifaiers based on some random data points.
 mnist.py:example of comperasion between the classifaiers based on images from mnist data set.
